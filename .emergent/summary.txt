The AI engineer successfully developed the Hiperautomação online course platform from scratch, iteratively adding complex features. Initially, a Netflix-style UI with admin/student interfaces, discussion system, and Bunny.net video embedding was created. Key challenges included video embedding, social feed enhancement, and robust user management with Brevo email integration. Subsequently, a comprehensive credit and monetization system was built, encompassing Abacate Pay integration for purchases, course pricing in credits/BRL, and a gamification system rewarding community interactions. A referral program with a purchase-dependent bonus structure was also implemented. Throughout, the engineer diligently resolved numerous backend errors (e.g., , syntax, async operations), frontend display issues, and managed sandbox payment complexities via polling and manual confirmations. Admin dashboards for finance, payment settings, and gamification configuration were also developed, demonstrating a strong ability to adapt and deliver against evolving requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an online course platform, Hiperautomação, with a Netflix-like interface, supporting an administrative area for course management (Course -> Modules -> Lessons with Bunny.net videos, texts, links), a student interface for viewing, and an integrated discussion system. Key features included modern UI/UX, email/password authentication, and advanced discussion capabilities.

Subsequent requirements included:
*   **User Management (Admin):** Add/remove, link to courses, grant full access, bulk import via CSV with Brevo email invitations and password creation links.
*   **Monetization & Credits:** Users can buy courses directly (R$) or purchase credit packages. Courses have credit costs. Credits earned via community interactions (discussions, comments, likes), inviting users, and course completion. Admin area to define credit values and manage financial aspects.
*   **Abacate Pay Integration:** For purchasing credits and direct courses.
*   **Community Gamification:** Users need at least 1 credit to participate. Rewards for interactions are given only to users who have made a purchase.
*   **Referral System:** Unique links for users, earning credits for sign-ups (initially) and a percentage of referred users' credit purchases (50% bonus if referrer has purchased).
*   **Access Control:** All published courses visible to all users, but content access restricted to purchased/enrolled courses.
*   **Admin Financial Management:** View purchases, manually add credits, manage Abacate Pay settings (dev/prod keys).
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Minimalist credit bar, correct display of referral links and course listings.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the gamification system for community interactions, as requested by the user. The specific requirements were that users need at least 1 credit to participate in the community, and they earn credits for interactions (like commenting), but only if they have made at least one purchase on the platform.

The work accomplished includes:
1.  **Backend ():**
    *   New API endpoints for managing  were added to allow administrators to configure the credit values for different actions.
    *   The existing  endpoint () was modified to incorporate the new gamification logic:
        *   It now checks if the user attempting to comment has a credit balance greater than or equal to 1. If not, the comment submission is blocked.
        *   If the user has sufficient credits and has previously made a purchase (), they are awarded credits based on the configured gamification settings for commenting. This ensures only engaged users who have invested in the platform can earn rewards.

The work concluded at the point of updating this specific backend endpoint. The next logical step is to create the corresponding frontend administration page for .
