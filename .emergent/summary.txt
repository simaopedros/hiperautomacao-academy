The AI engineer iteratively enhanced the Hiperautomação platform, starting with core features and progressing to complex systems. Initial tasks involved completing a configurable support link, fixing UI display issues, and refining gamification rules. A major focus was correcting the referral system logic to award 10 fixed credits upon first purchase and 50% of all subsequent credits earned. Significant efforts were dedicated to improving administrative user management by adding pagination, search, filters, and robust access control (full or multiple specific courses) during manual creation and CSV import. Security was addressed by preventing unauthorized admin account creation and removing account type selection from registration. Responsiveness for mobile devices was a continuous theme, applying improvements across key frontend pages. Email recovery functionality was implemented, requiring debugging due to incorrect collection names and function calls. The latest work focused on resolving discrepancies in displayed course counts and orphaned enrollments, with a cleanup script executed.

<product_requirements>
The Hiperautomação platform is a Netflix-style online course application featuring admin and student interfaces, discussion forums, and Bunny.net video integration. Core requirements include email/password authentication and social interaction. Further development focused on:

*   **User Management:** Admin controls for adding/removing users, linking courses, granting full access, and CSV bulk import with email invitations. This has been enhanced to allow granular access control (full platform access or multiple specific courses) during user creation and CSV import, and to display accurate enrollment status.
*   **Monetization & Credits:** Direct course purchase (R$) or credit packages. Credits earned via community, referrals, course completion. Admin defines credit values. Abacate Pay and Hotmart integrations. Referral system updated: 10 fixed credits on first referred purchase, plus 50% of all credits the referred user *earns*.
*   **Community Gamification:** Originally required 1 credit for participation. Now, all students with any course access or full access can participate and earn rewards.
*   **Access Control:** Content restricted to purchased/enrolled users. Course access validation implemented for social feed.
*   **Admin Financials:** View purchases, manage Abacate Pay/Hotmart settings.
*   **UI/UX:** Configurable support link, removal of Verificar Pagamento and Comprar Mais Créditos buttons, organized admin menu. Improved global responsiveness, specifically for , , and  pages, including correct ordering of elements on mobile.
*   **Account Recovery:** Implementation of password recovery via email.
*   **Security:** Prevent admin role selection during public registration and remove Tipo de Conta field from registration forms.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate why  still shows 0 enrollments even after cleanup, and ensure  now shows the correct course count (2 instead of 7) after orphaned enrollments were deleted.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing discrepancies in the displayed course counts for users in the administrative user management interface. Specifically, the user reported that  (who should be enrolled in one course) showed 0 courses, and  showed 7 courses when only 2 courses existed on the platform.

The work accomplished to resolve this includes:
1.  **Backend ():** The  endpoint was modified to filter user enrollments, ensuring only s that actually exist in the  collection are counted and returned. This prevents display of enrollments to deleted courses.
2.  **Database Cleanup Script:** A one-time manual script was executed using  commands to identify and delete orphaned enrollments from the  collection that pointed to non-existent s. This script reported deleting 5 orphaned enrollments.

The trajectory ended with the AI engineer about to re-verify the enrollment count for  after the cleanup. The underlying cause for 's 0 enrollment count, despite being seemingly enrolled, remains to be explicitly confirmed or resolved in the last message, although the orphaned enrollment cleanup is a related step.
