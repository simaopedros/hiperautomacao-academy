The AI engineer iteratively developed the Hiperautomação platform, starting with core course and user management features, then expanding into complex monetization, gamification, and referral systems. This trajectory highlights a strong focus on bug resolution across both backend (e.g.,  errors, async issues, webhook parsing, MongoDB schema inconsistencies) and frontend (e.g., UI display, routing). Key additions include Hotmart integration for sales and webhooks, a refined gamification system, and robust email capabilities via Brevo SMTP. The engineer also addressed UI/UX improvements, like reorganizing the admin menu. The most recent work involves implementing a configurable support link, continuing the iterative refinement of the application.
